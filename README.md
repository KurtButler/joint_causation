# Measuring Strength of Joint Causal Effects
In this repo, we provide MATLAB code to reproduce the results from our paper ...

> **Abstract:** 


## Instructions
To generate all figures (as .png files), you just need to run `main.m`. The code should run with no issues using Matlab 2022a or later. All generated figures and tables will be saved to the results folder. 
```
git clone https://github.com/KurtButler/joint_causation
```

## Data Availability
In our experiments, we used a publicly available data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- [New Taipei City Housing Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set), donated by I-Cheng Yeh at the Department of Civil Engineering, Tamkang University
